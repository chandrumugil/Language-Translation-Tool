The Language Translation Tool is built on Neural Machine Translation (NMT), which uses deep learning—particularly Transformer architecture—to convert text from one language to another. It leverages self-attention mechanisms to model dependencies between words, enabling context-aware translation.

Architecture: Encoder-Decoder Transformer

Libraries: Hugging Face Transformers, MarianMT, T5

Process: Input text → Tokenizer → Transformer → Decoder → Translated Output

Model: Pre-trained on large parallel corpora across multiple language pairs
